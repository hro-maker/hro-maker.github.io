					The story starts with a prologue from Landon Carter at age 57.
 The remainder of the story takes place when Landon is a 17-year-old
high school senior. Landon lives in the small, religious town of Beaufort,
North Carolina.
 His father is a genial, charismatic congressman.
Landon's father is not around very much, as he lives in Washington.
.Landon is more reclusive, which causes some tension in their relationship.
 Landon's father pressures him into running for class president. His best
friend, Eric Hunter, who is the most popular boy in school, helps him and,
to his surprise, Landon wins the election.
 As student body president, Landon is required to attend the school
dance with a date. He asks many girls, but none are available. That night,
he looks through his yearbook, trying to find an acceptable date. Since
nobody else seems to be available, Landon reluctantly asks Jamie Sullivan,
the daughter of Hegbert Sullivan, the Beaufort church minister, who
accepts his invitation. While Jamie is very religious and carries a Bible with
her wherever she goes, Landon (one of the popular students) is reluctant
to go to the dance with someone like her. When Landon is threatened by
Lew, Jamie comes to Landon's aid, to his appreciation. At the end of the
night, he admits she was the best date possible.
A few days later, Jamie asks Landon to participate in the school's
production of The Christmas Angel. While Landon is not very enthusiastic
about participating, he agrees to it anyway. Jamie, on the other hand,
could not be happier about her new castmate. Landon knows that if his
friends learn about his role in the play, he will be teased relentlessly. One
day at rehearsal, Jamie asks if Landon will walk her home, after which it
becomes routine.
 A couple of days later, Eric mocks the couple during their walk home
and Landon becomes truly embarrassed to be with Jamie. Meanwhile,
Landon continues to learn about all the people and organizations Jamie
spends her time helping, including an orphanage. Landon and Jamie visit
the orphanage one day to discuss a possible showing of The Christmas
Angely, but their proposal is quickly rejected by Mr. Jenkins. 
 When Jamie and Landon were waiting to meet Mr. Jenkins, she tells
Landon that all she wants in the future is to get married in a church full of
people and to have her father walk her down the aisle. While Landon
thinks this is a strange wish, he accepts it.
 In truth, he is beginning to enjoy his time with her.
 One day, while they are walking home, Landon yells at Jamie and he
tells her that he is not friends with her. The next day at the first show of
 “The Christmas Angel”,

 Jamie enters the stage dressed as the angel, making Landon simply
utter his line,
 "You're beautiful",
 meaning it for the first time. Following that, Jamie asks Landon if he
would go around town and retrieve the jars containing money collected for
the orphans' Christmas presents. When Landon collects the jars, there is
only $55.73, but when he gives the money to Jamie, there is $247.

 Jamie buys gifts for the orphanage, and Landon and Jamie spend
Christmas Eve there.

 Jamie's Christmas gift to Landon is her deceased mother's Bible. As they
get in the car to go home, Landon realizes his true feelings for her.
 "All I could do is wonder how I'd ever fallen in love with a girl like Jamie
Sullivan".

 He invites her to his house for Christmas dinner. The next day Landon
visits Jamie at her house, where they share their first kiss on her
porch. Afterward, Landon asks Hegbert if they can go to Flavin's, a local
restaurant, on New Year's Eve. While Hegbert initially refuses, after Landon
declares his love for Jamie, Hegbert allows it.
On New Year's Jamie and Landon go to dinner, where they share their first
dance.

 A couple of weeks later, Landon tells Jamie that he is in love with her. To
his surprise, Jamie replies by insisting that he cannot be. In response,
Landon demands an explanation, and Jamie reveals that she is dying
of leukemia. 
 The following Sunday, Hegbert announces to his congregation that his
daughter is dying. Jamie does not return to school the following Monday
and that it is eventually learned that she is too ill and will never return to
school.
 While they are having dinner at Landon's house, Jamie tells Landon,
 "I love you, too", for the first time”.


 A couple of weeks later, Eric and Margaret visit Jamie's house, where
they apologize for ever being rude to her. Eric gives Jamie the $400 that
he collected for the orphanage. Jamie refuses to stay at the hospital
because she wants to die at home. In turn, Landon's father helps to
provide Jamie the best equipment and doctors so she can spend the rest
of her life at home. This gesture helps to mend the gap between father
and son.
 One day, while sitting next to Jamie while she sleeps, Landon comes up
with an idea. He runs to the church to find Hegbert and asks him for
permission to marry Jamie. While Hegbert is reluctant, his refusal to deny
Landon's request is seen by Landon as approval. Landon runs back to
Jamie's side and asks,
 "Will you marry me?".

Landon and Jamie are married in a church full of people. Although she is
weak and in a wheelchair, she insists on walking down the aisle so that
her father could give her away which was part of her dream. Landon
remembers thinking
 "It was the most difficult walk anyone ever had to make. In every way, a
walk to remember"..

 When they reach the front of the church, Hegbert says,
 "I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart. But
what I can do is let another share in the joy that she has always given
me".
 Jamie feels badmake, grabs Landon by the hand.She looks into
Landon’s eyes a last time,shakes his hand and says, 

 “My dear husband,this was the most difficult and pleasant walk of my
life".

 These were Jamie's last words. Tears welled up in her eyes and one last
drop remained frozen in Landon's eyes.
Jamie died.

 Many years passed but Landon's love did not fade.He still loves Jamie
and wears his ring. He finishes the story by saying,
 "I now believe, by the way, that miracles can happen." <br>
